                    My name is Arianna Mitchell. I grew up in Speicher (AR), Switzerland, influenced by renowned Swiss
                    design
                    and a lot of fresh mountain air.

                I have always been drawn to art and design. There is always an idea, new picture, or some business idea
                running through my head. I am drawn to color and the beauty around me. Growing up I was constantly in my
                sketch book or having some kind of craft happening on the dining room table. In 1999, after completing
                my
                design studies in Geneva and Munich, I crossed the
                Atlantic and began designing in New York. Since then, I have worked at several prominent NYC design
                firms,
                including Thinkmap, where I
                served as Design Director and helped design the award-winning Visual Thesaurus. I now run my own studio,
                swissmiss, with recent clients including the Museum of Modern Art and the Food Network.

                My aesthetics reveal my Swiss roots: I am a firm believer in white space and clean, elegant design.
