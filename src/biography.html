            ABOUT ME
        </p>

        <p class="p1">
            My name is Arianna Mitchell. I grew up in Speicher (AR), Switzerland, influenced by renowned Swiss design
            and a lot of fresh mountain air.

            I am a creative. I can never seem to stop creating anything.

            I have always been drawn to art and design. There is always an idea, new picture, or some business idea
            running through my head. I am drawn to color and the beauty around me. Growing up I was constantly in my sketch book or having some kind of craft happening on the dining room table. In 1999, after completing my design studies in Geneva and Munich, I crossed the
            Atlantic and began designing in New York. Since then, I have worked at several prominent NYC design firms, including Thinkmap, where I
            served as Design Director and helped design the award-winning Visual Thesaurus. I now run my own studio,
            swissmiss, with recent clients including the Museum of Modern Art and the Food Network.

            My aesthetics reveal my Swiss roots: I am a firm believer in white space and clean, elegant design.
